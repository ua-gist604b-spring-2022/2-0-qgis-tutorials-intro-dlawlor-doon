# Assignment: Intro to QGIS

## Prerequisites
- Install QGIS 3.12+ on your workstation - [Download](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
- Optional: Watch this 32-minute QGIS Tutorial for Absolute Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCnNWyl9qSE

## Deliverable

1. `screencap-japan-map.png`
2. `screencap-populated-capitols.png`
3. `screencap-powerplants.png`
4. `screencap-csv-map.png`
5. `screencap-county-population.png`

## Background

In the world of open source software, documentation can be distributed among many sources and its quality may vary from project
to project. As with commercial software, documentation and online resources may be tied to specific versions of sofware
which may or may not be well documented. Additionally, the dynamic nature of open source software also may require complex 
dependencies on other open source projects which may or may not be pre-compiled for your particular operating system and
the particular version of dependency that you need. These complexities can often lead to significant "startup" costs to 
getting going with a particular software package. Likewise, outdated documentation or resources can lead to difficulty as
well. As a user of open source software, you will need to be able to use your research skills to seek out high quality 
information about the software that you are using or the problem you are addressing.

In this class, I am introducing you to a set of QGIS Tutorials provided and distributed under the Creative Commons License
and available from http://www.qgistutorials.com. The use of this site in this class is three-fold: 
1. You will be aware that it exists and recognize that it contains a number of very handy "recipes" for solving problems in QGIS
2. You will follow a number of the tutorials cookbook-style to gain some basic familiarity with QGIS.
3. You will glean enough information from the tutorials to accomplish your own tasks without following a recipe.
